          Graphene is 200 times stronger than steel and stronger than titanium,
          giving you our strongest pool ever. Our pools offer increased strength
          and rigidity of the pools structure and higher impact and flexural
          strength.

          Graphene is surprisingly light, giving our pools exceptional strength
          without added weight. Our pools are lighter making transport and crane
          lifts more efficient.

          Graphene Nano-Tech is a revolutionary process infusing graphene into
          every Aqua Technics pool. Graphene is the strongest material known to
          man and we have incorporated this nano-material to create our
          strongest pool ever built. With high-performing flexural strength, the
          pool is lighter, stronger and built like no other pool before. This
          ground-breaking, patent pending manufacturing process is the next
          generation of fiberglass pool technology.
