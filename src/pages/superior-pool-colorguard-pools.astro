          Only Aqua Technics Pools can offer you a patented surface protection
          system for fiberglass swimming pools that resists the effects of ultra
          violet rays and chemical attack. Itâ€™s like sunscreen for your swimming
          pool, protecting it from color loss and weathering. Incorporating a
          specialized dual coat system as part of the manufacturing process, two
          layers are merged to provide extraordinary surface protection.
          <p class="mb-6 font-light lg:mb-8 md:text-lg lg:text-xl mt-4">
            With a brilliant, high gloss finish that lasts year after year, your
            swimming pool will maintain its beautiful appearance thanks to the
            innovative and unique Pool ColorGuard. We dare you to compare.
